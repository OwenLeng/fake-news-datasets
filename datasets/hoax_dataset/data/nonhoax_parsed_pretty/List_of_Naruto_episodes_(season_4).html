Meanwhile, believing Naruto to be his closest friend, Sasuke prepares to kill him, finding the loss of Naruto to be an acceptable price for the Mangekyo Sharingan. Naruto's Rasengan and Sasuke's Chidori clash, though neither is capable of overpowering the other. Activating his cursed seal in order to gain the upper hand, Sasuke uses his Chidori to pierce through Naruto, just missing his heart. While Sasuke thinks the battle to be won, the demon fox's chakra begins to envelop Naruto and the wound Sasuke inflicted starts to heal.

It is not until his Sharingan fully develops that he is able to use his taijutsu to fend off Naruto, as well as a multitude of clones, and land a devastating blow. Needing more strength to fight, Naruto calls upon even more of the demon fox's chakra, which surrounds him and gives him the appearance of a one-tailed fox. This shroud acts as a shield, and Sasuke's attacks are quickly dispersed before reaching Naruto; the tangible chakra also acts as a potent weapon, negating the Sharingan's prediction abilities and allowing Naruto to attack from afar by extending the chakra into a claw-like attack. As the demon fox-form continues its onslaught, Sasuke is put on the defensive, forcing him to advance his cursed seal to its final level to compensate.&#160;</td>

After learning the truth, the adults turn on Akahoshi as well. After Akahoshi nearly kills Mizura, he is given no second chances. Not being one to lose, Akahoshi fuses his body with the Star, causing his chakra to go out of control. Naruto, guided by Natsuhi' s spirit, destroys the star and defeats Akahoshi. Although Tsunade initially seems upset over Naruto failing the mission, she concedes that the mission was "trash" due to being ordered by Akahoshi himself, and heals the children of their poisoning.&#160;</td>

However, this is too much for Kiba, and he rescues Akamaru, attempting to cure him on his own. Naruto pursues Kiba, who refuses to believe that Naruto is attempting to help him. Finally, Kiba's sister arrives, and with Naruto, attempts to restrain a now giant-sized and hostile Akamaru to administer a potential cure developed by Konoha's medical team. However, the cure only has a 50% chance of working. Kiba succeeds in the task, but is nearly killed in the process. It is later revealed that Akamaru tried his hardest to miss Kiba's vital points, something that Kiba thanks Akamaru for.&#160;</td>

Despite Naruto's efforts, it remains firmly attached to Naruto's back. Tsunade mentions that <a href="/wiki/Jiraiya_(Naruto)" title="Jiraiya (Naruto)">Jiraiya</a> once fought the Onbaa, although Tsunade paid him no heed at the time, believing him to be a fool. The Onbaa continues to increase in size, eventually becoming larger than Naruto himself. However, during a mission, it aids Naruto, causing Naruto to reconsider their relationship, but the Onbaa's mother appears, driving Naruto off and claiming her offspring. The child manages to calm the mother and Naruto is worn off and sleeps. After a while, Naruto awakes and feels something furry where he is lying, getting the feeling to be piggybacked. Naruto wakes up at the front of Konoha and looks behind him, seeing Ombu leaving with his mother and eventually saying goodbye. When Naruto returns to Tsunade, he laughs out loud. She asks how to get the Onbaa from there back. Naruto teases by saying he wrestled with them just like Jiraya did. She still doesn't believe him since the Onbaa has been proven to not be a legend. Everyone has an Onbaa and Naruto leaves laughing.&#160;</td>
