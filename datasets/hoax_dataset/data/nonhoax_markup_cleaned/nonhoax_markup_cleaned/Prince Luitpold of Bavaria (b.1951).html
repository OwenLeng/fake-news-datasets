'''Prince Luitpold of Bavaria''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Luitpold Rupprecht Heinrich  Prinz von Bayern'') (b. [[April 14]], [[1951]]) is a member of the [[Bavaria]]n Royal House of [[Wittelsbach]] and a [[CEO]] of '''König Ludwig GmbH & Co. KG Schlossbrauerei Kaltenberg'''.

==Early life==

Prince Luitpold was born at [[Leutstetten Castle|Schloß Leutstetten]] near [[Starnberg]], in [[Bavaria]]. He is the only surviving child of [[Prince Ludwig of Bavaria (b.1913)|Prince Ludwig of Bavaria]] and his wife [[Princess Irmingard of Bavaria]].

==Marriage==
On June25, 1979 Prince Luitpold married [[Beatrix Wiegand|Katrin Beatrix Wiegand]], the daughter of Gerd Wiegand and his wife Ellen Schumacher. The civil wedding took place at [[Starnberg]] and the religious ceremony followed a day later at the [[Andechs Abbey]] in [[Andechs]], [[Bavaria]]. Initially the union was considered morganatic, but on March 3, 1999 the marriage was decreed to be dynastic in accordance with the Bavarian house laws. The couple had five children:

* [[Princess Auguste of Bavaria (b.1979)|Princess Auguste of Bavaria]] (b. 1979)
* [[Princess Alice of Bavaria (b. 1981)|Princess Alice of Bavaria]] (b. 1981)
* [[Prince Ludwig of Bavaria (b. 1982)|Prince Ludwig of Bavaria]] (b. 1982)
* [[Prince Heinrich of Bavaria (b. 1982)|Prince Heinrich of Bavaria]] (b. 1986)
* [[Prince Karl of Bavaria (b. 1982)|Prince Karl of Bavaria]] (b. 1987)

==Later Life==

Prince Luitpold is a CEO of a brewery located at Kaltenberg Castle (''König Ludwig GmbH & Co. KG Schlossbrauerei Kaltenberg'') and an organizer of the annual jousting tournament at Kaltenberg.<br>
Because the current head of the Royal House of Bavaria, [[Franz, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Franz]] and his younger brother [[Prince Max, Duke in Bavaria|Max]] have no male offsprings, Luitpold’s father [[Prince Ludwig of Bavaria (b.1913)|Prince Ludwig]] will become the next in line of the Bavarian Succession.  Luitpold, who would technically succeed his father lost his succession rights in 1979 after his marriage to Beatrix Wiegand. Consequently, the Bavarian crown will then pass onto his son [[Prince Ludwig of Bavaria (b. 1982)|Prince Ludwig of Bavaria|Prince Ludwig]].
