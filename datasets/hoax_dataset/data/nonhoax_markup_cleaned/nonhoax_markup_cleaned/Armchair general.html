In unofficial [[military]] terminology, an armchair general is a somewhat derogatory term used to describe a member of the military in a high ranking position whose position is more bureaucratic than functional. Such an individual often possesses little combat or [[warfare]] experience if any. The term applies to Generals; some of whom never served in combat at all yet have attained high rank and carry out their duties in offices with significant staff, funding and paperwork. However the term need not apply solely to those with the rank of [[General]] and is a popular term often used among enlisted personnel and the media to describe high ranking officers especially those whose education or background comes from military academies and prior universities or those with privileged or wealthy families.
