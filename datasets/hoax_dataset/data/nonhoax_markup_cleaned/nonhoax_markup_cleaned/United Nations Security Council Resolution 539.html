'''[[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council resolution|Security Council Resolution]] 539''', adopted on October 28, 1983, after hearing a report from the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] and reaffirming resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 301|301]] (1971), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 385|385]] (1976), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 431|431]] (1978), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 432|432]] (1978), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 435|435]] (1978), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 439|439]] (1978) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 532|532]] (1983), the Council condemned [[South Africa]]'s continued occupation of [[Namibia]], then known as [[South West Africa]], and the tension and instability prevailing in [[southern Africa]] as a result. 

The resolution also condemned South Africa for its obstruction of the implementation of previous resolutions on Namibia, and rejected its attempts to link irrelevant issues to the declination of independence of Namibia. The Council reaffirmed the only basis for a peaceful settlement of the issue is to allow Namibian independence.

Finally, the Council urged South Africa to cooperate with the Secretary-General on plans for implementing the United Nations provisions outlined in Resolution 435, requesting him to report back to the Council by December 31, 1983.

Resolution 539 was adopted with 14 votes to none, while the [[United States]] abstained from voting.
