'''HMCS ''Trillium'' (K172)''' was a [[Flower class corvette|''Flower''-class corvette]] that served in the [[Royal Canadian Navy]].  She was ordered for the [[Royal Navy]] from [[Canadian Vickers|Canadian Vickers Ltd.]] in [[Montreal]] and laid down on 20 February 1940.  She was launched on 26 June 1940, transferred to the [[RCN]], and commissioned on 31 October 1940.  She was named after the ''[[Trillium]]'' genus of flowering plants including wakerobin, tri flower, and birthroot.

''Trillium'' escorted trade convoys between [[Halifax Harbour]] and [[Liverpool]] through the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939â€“1945)|battle of the Atlantic]].  The ship was returned to the Royal Navy after it escorted the last [[HX convoys|HX convoy]] of the war.  It was sold for civilian use as ''Olympic Winner'' in 1950 and renamed ''Otori Maru'' No. 10 in 1956.
