==Biography==
Chicherina was born in 1978 [[Sverdlovsk]], which is now known as [[Yekaterinburg]].  She is a descendant of [[Georgy Chicherin]], the People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs.  In her childhood she sung in the children's choir "Goroshinki".  She spent some of her time drawing and attempted to get accepted into an art institute.  For a short time she played on the guitar and drums in various bands, then entered a musical school as a pop vocalist.

In 1997 she formed her own musical collective in which alongside Chicherina herself entered Azat Mukhammetov, Aleksandr Buriy and Aleksandr "DrOff" Aleksandrov.  On June 1st, 1997 the first appearance of Chicherina occurred in the club "J-22".  The group played at several festivals in western [[Siberia]], and after the cassette with Chicherina's recordings was sent to Mikhail Kozyrev (the producer of [[Nashe Radio]]), they were invited to the [[Nashestvie]] festival.
