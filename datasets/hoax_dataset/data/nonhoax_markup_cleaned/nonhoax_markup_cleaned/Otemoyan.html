==Origin of the Song==
*Originally, it was a song at drinking parties with [[geisha]] girls, and there have been several hypotheses. The most strong one was that Otemoyan was a girl named Chimo Tominaga(1868-1935) who really lived near the present Kumamoto Station. The writer/composer was Ine Nagata who was a teacher of samisen and Japanese dances.  This song made a record debut by Akasaka Koume in 1935. There were smallpox scars on the face who wanted to love Chimo. However, there are other views which are not so strong. The oldest song was recorded in "5 Pairs of shoes" in 1907.
