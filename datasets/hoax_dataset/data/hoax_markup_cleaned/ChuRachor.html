In the [[Dungeons and Dragons fantasy roleplaying game, ChuRachors are Elephantillian Humaniods. ChuRachors disable there opponents by use of their repulsive odor ( a mixture of Elephant Urine and Hippopatamus dung ) and incredibly loud and obnoxious voices. They can also confuse their enemies by telling tall-tales and far-fetched stories. ChuRachors also mate with domestic horses to produce another humaniod called the SmithRachorian ( a wondering eyed, black lipped, speech impediment cursed hybrid ). The ChuRachor can only be eliminated by sustaining injuries to the neck which besides its own unquenchable hunger is its only weakness.
