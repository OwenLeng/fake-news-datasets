'''Ghost Drops''' are an Australian [[candy|hard boiled lolly]] produced by independent Australian [[confectionary|confectioners]] [[Douglas & Prendergast]] and distributed by [[Allfect Ltd]]. The recipe for Ghost Drops was first developed by renowned Melbourne confectioner [[Zachary Douglas]] in 1967 at his home in [[Blairgowrie, Victoria|Blairgowrie]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. The product was then refined with his collaborator [[Jack Prendergast]] and sold throughout Australia later that year. Ever since, the Ghost Drop has become an Australian tradition with millions being consumed every year with flavours such as grape, strawberry and apple. Ghost Drops were recalled at one point in 1998 because of apparent contamination from metal shavings.
