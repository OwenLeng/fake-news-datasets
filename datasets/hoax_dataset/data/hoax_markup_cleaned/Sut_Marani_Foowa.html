During his time as Bangladeshi international Sut Marani was scouted by some of the biggest clubs in Europe including the likes of Barcelona, Madrid and English premier League champions Manchester united. However his reluctance to leave his beloved homeland and forsake the wearing of the lungi meant that he wasn't a viable signing.
