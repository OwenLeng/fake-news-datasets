=== Notes ===
* &lt;small>{{note|1|Note 1}}: The housemates were divided in two teams, with Dian and Elena being the captain of each team. The team of Dian won the competition, so she's the HoH of the week. Elena was automatically nominated as lossing team captain.
* {{note|2|Note 2}}: In each week three people have to be nominated for eviction. Martin has the most votes from the housemates on the first nominations - 8 points. After Martin and Elena are the nominated persons, Dian chose the 3rd person - Katerina who will join Martin and Elena at the first eliminations.
* {{note|3|Note 3}}: On the second nominations Elitsa &amp; Katerina had the highest votes from all the Housemates. It was a tie. The rules say that the person who's on first place (with the most nominated votes) is up to eviction, but the two girls had 6 points from the 2nd nominations, so they went to the nominations. And the nominated persons were four.
