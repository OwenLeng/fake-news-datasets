The '''Partridge Chicken''' is a breed of [[domestic chicken]]. It was first introduced to [[England]] in 1860. They are 20â€“30&nbsp;cm in height, are heavily feathered down the shanks and toes and appear to be much larger than they actually are. They are very gentle, excellent setters, require little space, and have many colour varieties.

Partridge chickens are the most popular of the feather-legged [[Bantam (poultry)|bantams]] and known to breeders as one of the best setters. The male's saddle and hackle feathers are a rich, brilliant orange-red which, when combined with the greenish-black body, makes for an extremely attractive bird. The female is feathered in glossy, mahogany brown, penciled in black.

==History==
Several explanations exist regarding how the birds were brought to England, the most popular being that they were introduced by soldiers returning from China in the 1860s. Another version suggests that the birds may have been looted from the private collection of the Emperor of China. Yet another story suggests that a consignment of birds from China was given to Queen Victoria. These are subject to some debate within the chicken breeders' community.

==Characteristics==
The most distinctive feature of the partridge chicken is the excessive feathering on the legs and feet. The skin beneath the feathers is yellow and the eggs are brown; their eggs are medium in size.
