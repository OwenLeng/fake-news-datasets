'''''Disney's All-Star Battle''''' (stylized as ''Disney's Allâ‹†Star Battle'') is a Disney Channel reality television series that replaces the Olympic-styled challenge show, ''[[Disney Channel Games]]''. It is set to air in the fourth quarter of Disney's television schedule.

==Overview==
''Disney's All-Star Battle'' stars various Disney Channel stars under one roof competing for $100,000 and the title of "Top Disney Star of All Time". The competition has the stars divided into two teams and they are put to the test every week in an endless array of physical and mental challenges. Each week, the stars go head-to-head in an individual competition where the winner earns control over the teams and protection from elimination, also called the "Captain's Challenge." There also is a team challenge, where the stars test their ability to work together. The losing team nominates two players to go up for elimination, while the winners of the team challenge receive immunity, a night out at the club and decide which player to send home.
