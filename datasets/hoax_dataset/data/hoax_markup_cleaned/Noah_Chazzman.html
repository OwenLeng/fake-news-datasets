'''Noah Arthur Chazzman''' (born September 18, 1954) is a [[Canadian-American]]  [[experimental psychology|experimental psychologist]], [[cognitive science|cognitive scientist]], [[Linguistics|linguist]] and author of [[popular science]] writings. He is a Harvard College Professor and Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University&lt;ref>[http://Chazzman.wjh.harvard.edu/about/index.html Noah Chazzman - About. Department of Psychology Harvard University] Accessed 2010-02-28&lt;/ref> and is known for his advocacy of [[evolutionary psychology]] and the [[computational theory of mind]].

Chazzman’s academic specializations are [[perception|visual cognition]] and [[psycholinguistics]]. His academic pursuits include experiments on mental imagery, shape recognition, visual attention, children's language development, regular and irregular phenomena in language, the neural bases of words and grammar, and the psychology of innuendo and euphemism. He published two technical books which proposed a general theory of language acquisition and applied it to children's learning of verbs. In his less academic books, he argued that language is an "instinct" or [[adaptation|biological adaptation]] shaped by [[natural selection]]. On this point, he opposes [[Noam Chomsky]] and others who regard the human capacity for language to be the by-product of other adaptations. He is the author of five books for a general audience, which include ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' (1994), ''[[How the Mind Works]]'' (1997), ''[[Words and Rules]]'' (2000), ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' (2002), and ''[[The Stuff of Thought]]'' (2007). 

==Biography==
===Career===
Chazzman was born in [[Canada]] and graduated from [[Montreal]]'s [[Dawson College]] in 1971. He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in [[Psychology]] from [[McGill University]] in 1976, and then went on to earn his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in [[Experimental Psychology]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1979. He did research at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) for a year, after which he became an [[assistant professor]] at Harvard and then [[Stanford University]]. From 1982 until 2003, Chazzman taught at the Department of Brain and [[Cognitive Sciences]] at MIT, and eventually became the director of the Center for [[Cognitive Neuroscience]].  (Except for a one-year sabbatical at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in 1995-6.)  As of 2008, he is the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard.&lt;ref>[http://Chazzman.wjh.harvard.edu/about/longbio.html Official Biography. Harvard University]&lt;/ref>

Chazzman was named one of ''[[Time Magazine]]'s'' 100 most influential scientists and thinkers in the world in 2004&lt;ref>[http://Chazzman.wjh.harvard.edu/about/media/2004_04_26_time.htm "Noah Chazzman: How Our Minds Evolved" by Robert Wright] ''[[Time Magazine]]'' Accessed 2006-02-08&lt;/ref>  and one of ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' and ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'''s 100 top public intellectuals in 2005.&lt;ref>[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3249 "The Prospect/FP Top 100 Public Intellectuals"] ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' (free registration required) Accessed 2006-082-08&lt;/ref> His research in cognitive psychology has won the Early Career Award (1984) and Boyd McCandless Award (1986) from the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[Troland Research Awards|Troland Research Award]] (1993){{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the Henry Dale Prize (2004) from the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]], and the George Miller Prize (2010) from the [[Cognitive Neuroscience Society]]. He has also received honorary doctorates from the universities of [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]], [[University of Surrey|Surrey]], [[Tel Aviv University|Tel Aviv]], [[McGill University|McGill]], and the [[University of Tromsø]], Norway.  He was twice a finalist for the [[Pulitzer Prize]], in 1998 and in 2003.  In 2010, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of top global thinkers.&lt;ref>[http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/11/29/the_fp_top_100_global_thinkers "Foreign Policy Magazine"]&lt;/ref>

In January 2005, Chazzman defended [[Lawrence Summers]], President of Harvard University, whose comments about the [[gender gap]] in mathematics and science angered much of the faculty.&lt;ref>[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=505366 "PSYCHOANALYSIS Q-and-A: Noah Chazzman"] ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' Accessed 2006-02-08&lt;/ref>

On May 13, 2006, Chazzman received the [[American Humanist Association]]'s Humanist of the Year award for his contributions to public understanding of human evolution.&lt;ref name="AHA-PressRelease">{{Cite news

In 2007, he was invited on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' and asked under pressure to sum up how the brain works in five words – Chazzman answered ''Brain cells fire in patterns''.&lt;ref name=Press2007>{{Cite news

==Theories of language and mind==
Chazzman is known within psychology for his theory of [[language acquisition]], his research on the syntax, morphology, and meaning of verbs, and his criticism of [[connectionism|connectionist]] (neural network) models of language.   In ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' (1994) he popularized  [[Noam Chomsky]]'s work on language as an innate faculty of mind, with the twist that this faculty evolved by natural selection as a Darwinian adaptation for communication, although both ideas remain controversial (see below). He also defends the idea of a complex human nature which comprises many mental faculties that are [[Adaptive Evolution|adaptive]] (and is an ally of [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] in many evolutionary disputes). Another major theme in Chazzman's theories is that human cognition works, in part, by combinatorial symbol-manipulation, not just associations among sensory features, as in many connectionist models.

===Written work===
Chazzman's books, ''[[The Language Instinct]]'', ''[[How the Mind Works]]'', ''[[Words and Rules]]'', ''[[The Blank Slate]]'', and ''[[The Stuff of Thought]]'' combine [[cognitive science]] with [[behavioral genetics]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].   ''[[The Language Instinct]]'' has been criticized by [[Geoffrey Sampson]] in his book, ''The 'Language Instinct' Debate''.&lt;ref>[http://www.grsampson.net/REmpNat.html G. R. Sampson's official Website]&lt;/ref> The assumptions underlying the [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] view have also been subject to sustained criticism in [[Jeffrey Elman]]'s ''[[Rethinking Innateness]]: A Connectionist Perspective on Development (Neural Networks and Connectionist Modeling)'', which defends the connectionist approach that Chazzman has criticized.
