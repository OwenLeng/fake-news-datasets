'''Bovinophobia''' is a [[specific phobia]], which is a fear or aversion to [[cattle]]. The condition can cause [[anxiety]] and [[panic attack]]s.

Although uncommon in rural communities the fear of cows has become an increasing phenomenon as the world's population has become more urban. Bovophobia has been the subject of one major psychological study [1] and several psychiatric case studies. It is specifically defined as different from the rational and legitimate fear for one's safety that may result from proximity to a dangerous bovine. It is by definition an irrational fear. As such many sufferers invent spurious lies in order to justify their fear to themselves or others. One example would be the surprisingly common assertion that cows are subject to random and violent outbursts because they "see thing's bigger than they are".
