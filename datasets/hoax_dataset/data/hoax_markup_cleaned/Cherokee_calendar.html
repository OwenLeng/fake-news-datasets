'''Cherokee calendar''' "Nvda Disesdi" (Cherokee: ᏅᏓ ᏗᏎᏍᏗ) The [[Cherokee]] calendar is a combination of a Venus calendar, [[solar calendar]] and a [[lunar calendar]]. It was the responsibility of the [[Cherokee]] day keeper to coordinate these three calendars in order to calculate the time of [[ceremonies]]. The Cherokee Venus calendar is of 260 solar days with 13, 20 day months, which is the Cherokee 20 day signs. A Cherokee month is a 28 day lunar month with 13 months equaling 365 days. The new moon is the first day of every month. A Cherokee week is 13 solar days. A solar year is 360 solar days. Plus 5 or 6 solar days until the [[heliacal setting]] of the [[Pleiades]]. There are 20 day signs that repeat continuously. The 52 year cycle of the Pleiades is called "the mouth of the rattlesnake".

==Cherokee new year==
The Cherokee [[new year]] or "the great new moon" is the first [[new moon]] in [[autumn]], after the setting of the Pleiades star cluster. The first of the month is a [[holiday|Sabbath]] day of [[leisure|quiet reflection]] and [[prayer]]. [[Fasting]] is encouraged, and the very observant fast for 4 days: as the moon is empty of light for those days, they are empty of food. Work, cooking, sex and childbirth were prohibited during the empty moon days, "Un-time" or "Non-days". A childbirth during these days was unlucky. It is believed that the mother and child were simply hallucinating, and thought the birth was on a "non-day". The [[Leonids]] meteoric shower around that time of the year sets off fireworks to celibate the new year. Hunting Moon is the first month of the year. In modern times in order to avoid the fluctuations of the lunar calendar, the date of the new year has been set to November 1 [[Gregorian]].
