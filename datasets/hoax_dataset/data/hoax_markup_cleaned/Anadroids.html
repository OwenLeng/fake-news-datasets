[[Anadroids]] is a [[Disney Channel Original Series]] in production. It consists of a basic plot, running about 15 minutes in length. There is a usual quarrel between the 'good' side and the 'bad' side of each episode, but never actual violence. The series does have a crude humor side to it, so the series was pronounced TV-Y7, like fellow series, [[Phineas and Ferb]], though may be changed later to TV-G, also like Phineas and Ferb. Each episode usually has all of the characters, though not all of them talk.

Good Side:
*''Anadroid 77''
*''Robodroid 1''
*''Buttercup''

Bad Side:

*''Gearon 2''

A sneek peek is said to premiere after the premiere of [[Camp Rock]].
