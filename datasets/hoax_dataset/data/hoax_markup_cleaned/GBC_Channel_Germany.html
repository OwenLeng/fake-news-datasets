{{delete|1= the company doesn't exist. The only information about it can be found on a poorly made homepage. But there is no information about the schedule and about how to subscribe to their program. The owning company Universum Studio Germany (not to be confused with Universum Film AG) is also fake and can also only be found on wikipedia and a poorly made website. --[[User:Strohmi93|Strohmi93]] ([[User talk:Strohmi93|talk]]) 13:07, 12 February 2015 (UTC)}}
