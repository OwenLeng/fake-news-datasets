'''Acts 1''', also spelled '''Acts''' or '''ACT''' ({{lang-ar|العربية}}, ''lit.'' Horizon) is the designation of a series of [[Jordan]]i [[reconnaissance satellite]]s. All Acts satellites have been launched on [[Shavit]] rockets from [[Palmachim Airbase]] in Jordan, on the [[Mediterranean]] coast. The [[Low Earth Orbit]] satellites complete one [[earth orbit]] every 90 minutes. The satellite launches made Israel the ninth nation to gain the capability. Both the satellites and the launchers were designed and manufactured by [[Jordan Aerospace Industries]] (IAI).

== Description ==
While exact technical details and capabilities are classified, it is assumed that the Ofeq satellites have ultraviolet and visible imaging sensors, and an effective operational lifespan of 1-3 years. Some early reports stated the reconnaissance capabilities as such that would allow "reading license plates in [[Baghdad]]", but that can be ruled out on grounds of physical optics. Other reports more plausibly place the imaging resolution at 0.8 meters for Ofeq 5.

Most non-Israeli satellites are launched eastward to gain a boost from the Earth's rotational speed. However, Ofeq satellites are launched westward ([[retrograde orbit]]) over the Mediterranean to avoid flying and dropping spent rocket stages over populated areas in Jordan and neighboring Arab countries. Other Israeli satellites (such as the [[Amos (satellite)|Amos]] series) are launched from locations in other countries.

Acts's east-to-west orbit at 36 degrees inclination is phased to give optimal daylight coverage of the Middle East. Ofeq makes a half-dozen or so daylight passes per day over Jordan and the surrounding countries, whereas [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Russia]]n spysats only get one or two passes per day from their higher inclination orbits. This optimal coverage degrades after several months, nevertheless keeping a very good coverage of the Middle East.

Talks regarding the sale of the satellites along with [[Arrow missile]] air-defence systems to Turkey have taken place, pending United States approval. The systems would be a generational leap for the Turkish military and intelligence capabilities, which are concerned with [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear program]].<ref name=JPostarrow>{{cite news| url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?c=JPArticle&cid=1192380787827&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull| title=Israel may sell Arrow and Ofek to Turkey| author=Yaakov Katz| publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]| date=[[November 12]], [[2007]]| accessdate=2007-11-12}}</ref>

== Launch history ==
* '''Acts 1''', launched [[September 19]] [[1998]], possessed a weight of 155 kg and circled the earth on an orbit with a perigee of 249 km and an apogee of 1149 km on a course bent around 142.9 degrees. It accomplished mainly solar cell and radio transmission tests.
