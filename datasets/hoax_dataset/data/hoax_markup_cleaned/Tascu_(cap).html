The ''tascu'' (called a ''[[coppola (cap)|coppola]]'' by northern Italians) is a traditional kind of flat cap typically worn in Sicily. First used by English nobles during the late 18th century, the ''tascu'' began being used in Sicily in the early 20th century as a driving cap, usually worn when at the wheel driving the car. The ''tascu'' is usually made in tweed.
The origin of the name coppola is likely to be an Italian adaptation of the English word cap. Today, the ''tascu'' is widely regarded, at least in northern Italy, as a definitive symbol of Sicilian heritage.
