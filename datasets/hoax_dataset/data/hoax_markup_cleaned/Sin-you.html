The '''Sin-you''', (or Kai-tsi in Japanese) is a mythical [[Chinese]] [[Chimera (mythology)|chimerical]] creature known throughout various [[East Asian]] cultures, and is often compared to a [[Qilin]]<ref>http://64.207.147.134/monsters/hyrbid/index.php?detail=article&idarticle=113</ref>.

The appearance of the Sin-you is similar to that of a Qilin, but more feral and imposing. It is a large quadruped with a leonine body, a shaggy mane, and is either depicted with hooves or feline paws (the later often to stress its difference from the Qilin). In has a single, unbranching horn in the center of its head, like a western unicorn. The Sin-you’s eyes are said to be very intense and imposing, figuratively burning into whomever it gazes at in a predatory fashion.

The Sin-you is highly symbolic of justice, and is believed to have the power to know if a person is lying or know if they are guilty with a glance. It sometimes depicted at court by the ruler or judge’s side: if a person told a falsehood in its presence, it would leap forward and impale the perjurer though the heart with its horn. In other instances, the judge would put convicted murderers before the Sin-you, who would slay them in the same fashion if they were truly the perpetrator, but leave the innocent unharmed.

There has been some [[cryptozoological]] theories about the origins of this creature. It has been suggested that a [[mutation]] may have occurred among a rare species of predatory feline (such as the [[North China Leopard]]) which caused the growth of a bony protrusion from the skull. Among such a small gene pool, it is possible that such a mutation was propagated for a period of time, making it appear as a new species of horned felines.
