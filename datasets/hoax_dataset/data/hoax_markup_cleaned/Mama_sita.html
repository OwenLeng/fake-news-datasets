'''Mama Sita''' was an Italian priest born in modern-day Bologna, Italy in 45AD.
There are a limited number of records surrounding the life of Mama Sita but it is believed in urban mythical terms, that Mama claimed to have strong relations to that of '''Cesil Russo''' known for the architectual design of 'Sourcey Tiles,' more commonly spoken about as 'Il Sourcey Pavimenta,' uncovered in the early 1800's by a group of researchers known only as 'C.E.S.'
Mama Sita was also believed to be involved in the 'Balloon Theory' or in his native tongue, 'Gonfia la Teoria.' This theory involved research into the use of early rubber, and only received its given name of 'Balloon' in 1709 by [Bartolomeu de Gusm√£o.]
