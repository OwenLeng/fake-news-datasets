Task:
* binary classification - rumour detection (according to files structure)

We recently release a dataset (in Chinese) on fake news from Wechat. The dataset includes news titile, report content, news url and image url.

The data folder contains a subset of weibo dataset for a quick start. If you are interested in full weibo dataset, you can download it via [https://drive.google.com/file/d/14VQ7EWPiFeGzxp3XC2DeEHi-BEisDINn/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14VQ7EWPiFeGzxp3XC2DeEHi-BEisDINn/view?usp=sharing). (Approximately 1.3GB)

One of the unique challenges for fake news detection on social media is how to identify fake news on newly emerged events. The EANN is desgined to extract shared features among all events to effectively improve the performance of fake news detection on never-seen events.

**Note:** As the data of this dataset are split into multiple `.txt` and `.jpg` files, analysis is not performed for this dataset. However, at least meta information in datasets README file and data itself are provided.

**Note2:** Language of textual attributes is not English, but Chinese.

**Note3:** The data folder contains a subset of weibo dataset for a quick start. If you are interested in full weibo dataset, you can download it (link in description above, approximately 1.3GB).

**Note4:** Data contain also images (see data folder). 

**Note5:** As the language used is Chinese, also stop-words are included.
