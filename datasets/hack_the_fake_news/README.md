The corpus was automat- ically collected, and then annotated by stu- dents of journalism.

The news come from 377 dif- ferent sources from various domains, includ- ing politics, interesting facts and tips&tricks. The dataset was prepared for the Hack the Fake News hackathon. It was provided by the Bulgarian Association of PR Agencies3 and is available in Gitlab4. The corpus was automat- ically collected, and then annotated by stu- dents of journalism. Each entry in the dataset consists of the following elements: URL of the original article, date of publication, arti- cle heading, article content, a label indicating whether the article is fake or not, and another label indicating whether it is a click-bait. The training dataset contains 2,815 exam-
ples, where 1,940 (i.e., 69%) are fake news and 1,968 (i.e., 70%) are click-baits; we further have 761 testing examples. However, there is 98% correlation between fake news and click- baits, i.e., a model trained on fake news would do well on click-baits and vice versa. Thus, below we focus on fake news detection only
