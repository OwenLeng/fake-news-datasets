Task:
* binary classification - fake news detection, according to files structure (`fake` and `legit` folders)

We constructed two novel datasets containing fake news covering several news domains and specifically model the deceptive property of fake news. One dataset is collected via crowdsourcing covering six news domains (e.g., business, education). The second dataset is obtained directly from the web and covers celebrity news.

**Note:** As the data of this dataset are split into multiple `.txt` files, analysis is not performed for this dataset. However, at least meta information in datasets README file and data itself are provided.

**Note2:** Two datasets were created and labeled by more than one common methodology, please refer to paper for more details (link above).
